# React Boilerplate

A basic boilerplate for React apps. This is just a frontend app using a react-redux setup.

#### Development

To build the frontend (outputs to `frontend/dist`):

```bash
$ yarn run watch
```

You can use `npm run watch` if you do not have yarn installed

#### Serve

To serve the frontend you can use

```bash
$ cd dist
$ ecstatic
```
